# Terminal CRT Effect

This was basically made to demonstrate how CRTs work, for an upcoming video.

# How it works

It is super simple all you need is a 2 Dimensional Array with values of 0 or 1 inside them and call the function with the array passed inside it. I've made example messages and even a simple shape.

# How to run

 To execute use ```py main.py``` works in Windows without changes but if on linux change ```system('cls')``` on line 61 to ```system("clear")``` (Will Soonâ„¢ make it that it automatically detects and does it automagically)

 For best results make your font size in Terminal or Console to the minimum.
