# Terminal CRT Effect

![Well you were supposed to have a GIF here, so I guess try to reload the page?](/readmeimagesandstuffswhyareyoureadingthis/demo.gif)

This was basically made to demonstrate how CRTs work, for an upcoming video.

# How it works

It is super simple all you need is a 2 Dimensional Array with values of 0 or 1 inside them and call the function with the array passed inside it. I've made example messages and even a simple shape.

So it loops through the 2d array given and draws each "pixel" one by one, simulating a real CRT with an electron beam

# How to run

 To execute use ```py main.py``` works in Windows without changes but if on linux change ```system('cls')``` on line 61 to ```system("clear")``` (Will Soonâ„¢ make it that it automatically detects and does it automagically)

 For best results make your font size in Terminal or Console to the minimum. I also prefer to make the window 80 x 25 on CMD, you do not have to do this.
